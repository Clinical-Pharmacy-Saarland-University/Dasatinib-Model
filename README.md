# Dasatinib-Model
Whole-body PBPK model of dasatinib as sensitive CYP3A4 substrate

# Repository files
Within this repository, we distribute a whole-body PBPK model of dasatinib. As a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate and weak base with strong pH‐sensitive solubility, dasatinib is highly susceptible to enzyme‐mediated and pH‐dependent DDIs with CYP3A4 perpetrators and acid‐reducing agents, respectively. Developed using plasma concentration–time profiles from 19 clinical trials, the model is able to describe and predict dasatinib plasma concentration–time profiles in both healthy volunteers and cancer patients. It accounts for dasatinib’s role as both a CYP3A4 victim and a perpetrator of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and OATP1B1/1B3. Additionally, the model was coupled with various CYP3A4 perpetrator models to provide model‐based dasatinib dosing recommendations for single and complex multiple DDIs, supporting dasatinib precision dosing.
